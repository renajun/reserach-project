          <h5>Criticism of War</h5>
          <p>Art was used as protest, propaganda, and generally a way to express emotions related to wars. Artists ironically used war propaganda materials, such as posters and advertisements, to criticize the drafting of thousands and bring to light the consequences of war.

              <h5>Criticism of Society</h5>
              <p>After World War II, the post-war economic boom, the rise of TV and advertising, and the rise of factories, created a consumerist culture like never before. Capitalism defined Americans as mass production and popular culture began influencing society. However, people began to criticize this frenzy of consumerism, its artificiality, and the negative societal effects.

          <h5>Criticism of Art</h5>
            <p>Prior to the 60s, the art world had always been known as a high class subject and was rarely accessible to the general public. As the 20th century progressed, art became more experimental and slowly moved away from its exclusive high class status. Pop Art became the criticism’s final push, with its main focus on making art accessible and relatable to the masses.

            <p>
              Known as the pioneer of Pop Art, Eduardo Paolozzi used his art to criticize the government’s criticisms towards art and their decisions regarding World War II. Paolozzi was one of the many members of the Independent Group, a group of artists who focused their work on social commentary. Their influence on the art community was tremendous as they created the foundation of Pop Art. By creating the basis of the Pop Art movement, Paolozzi inspired many other icons of this time such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichenstein.
