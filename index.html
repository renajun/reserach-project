          <h5>Criticism of War</h5>
          <p>Art was used as protest, propaganda, and generally a way to express emotions related to wars. Artists ironically used war propaganda materials, such as posters and advertisements, to criticize the drafting of thousands and bring to light the consequences of war.

              <p>After World War II, the post-war economic boom, the rise of TV and advertising, and the rise of factories, created a consumerist culture like never before. Capitalism defined Americans as mass production and popular culture began influencing society. However, people began to criticize this frenzy of consumerism, its artificiality, and the negative societal effects.

          <h5>Criticism of Art</h5>
            <p>Prior to the 60s, the art world had always been known as a high class subject and was rarely accessible to the general public. As the 20th century progressed, art became more experimental and slowly moved away from its exclusive high class status. Pop Art became the criticism’s final push, with its main focus on making art accessible and relatable to the masses.

            <p>
              Known as the pioneer of Pop Art, Eduardo Paolozzi used his art to criticize the government’s criticisms towards art and their decisions regarding World War II. Paolozzi was one of the many members of the Independent Group, a group of artists who focused their work on social commentary. Their influence on the art community was tremendous as they created the foundation of Pop Art.

            <h2 class="fw-bold">Abstract Expressionism</h2>
            <p>
              Abstract Expressionism was the movement that emerged from the influences of Paolozzi. AbEx served as a response to the harsh realities of war, revealing the outcomes that not many people wanted to have a conversation about. Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns were leading Abstract Expressionists, the movement before Pop Art.

            <p>
              Pop Art emerged as a result of AbEx but ironically criticized and contrasted the movement. It was an art movement that criticized consumerism, mass production, and war. Pop Art was one of the first types of art to appeal to the general public because of its focus on using commercial objects. Art used to be seen as an elitist activity/subject, but Pop Art’s criticism of high art also made this form of art relatable to the masses. Leaders of the Pop Art movement include Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.

            <p>
              Pop Art opened people’s eyes to the toxic culture of consumerism and popular culture. Pop Art also brought art down to the general public and it was accessible to everyone. It blurred the inequality of wealth and was something that reflected everyone. It became a way of self expression and a form of protest. Additionally, due to the movement’s innovation, it also inspired future art movements such as Minimalism and Post-Impressionism.
